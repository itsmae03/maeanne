		 		<br>Your scars will heal and on days when you poke it, it’ll cause no pain. You’ll find solace in your past, the memories that sting and the bumpy ride because it’s part of the process of being your better self.</br>
                <br>You’ll find strength to look into the eyes of those that hurt you, take away their power to because now, you call the shots. You’ll find kindness and warmth in the hands of strangers and friendship in the most unexpected places.</br>
